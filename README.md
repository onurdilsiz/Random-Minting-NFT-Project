# Random-Minting-NFT-Project
An NFT project   
  Project has 20 pictures (photos of various universities) and i created nft of them, but it is such a scenario that random people come and pay for it and RANDOMLY mint the pictures we have and own them.   
  - It is such a contract that after deploying the contract, the person who wants it mints one of the pictures as nft with the buyNFT function. 
  - However, this minting has to be random. One should not know whether to take Bogazici, METU or Oxford. 
  - Minting gets random NFT at the end. 
  - - Price of 1 NFT is 1 wei. 
  - - Contract Pausable  
  - In short, erc721 mints with a random id and that id is mapped to the image.

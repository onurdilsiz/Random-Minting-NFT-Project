# Random-Minting-NFT-Project
An NFT project   We have 20 pictures (photos of various universities) and we will do nft of them, but it is such a scenario that random people come and pay for it and RANDOMLY mint the pictures we have and own them.   - It is such a contract that after deploying the contract, the person who wants it mints one of the pictures as nft with the buyNFT function. - However, this minting has to be random. One should not know whether to criticize Bosphorus, Woodland or Oxford. - Minting gets random NFT at the end. - Price of 1 NFT is 1 wei. - Contract Pausable  In short, erc721 mints with a random id and that id is mapped to the image.
